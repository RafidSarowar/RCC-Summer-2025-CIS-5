 * Purpose:   A program that will read in the number of liters of gasoline consumed by the userâ€™s car and 
 *            the number of miles traveled by the car and will then output the number of miles per gallon the car delivered.
 *            And takes the same input for another car and compares to give a argument of which car is more efficient.
